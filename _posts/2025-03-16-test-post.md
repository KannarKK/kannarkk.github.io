## The What

Let $$A$$ be an $$m \times n$$ matrix and $$B$$ be an $$n \times p$$ matrix. Then, the product $$C = AB$$ is defined and results in an $$m \times p$$ matrix $$C$$ whose entries are:

$$
C_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} A_{ik} B_{kj}.
$$

This forms the basis of many ML operations such as <i>backpropagation</i>, where matrix multiplication is used extensively.
