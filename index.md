### Hello, I'm Kiran.

I am a Machine Learning Technical Lead at [Infinitus Systems](https://www.infinitus.ai), where we automate phone calls in healthcare. My current work focuses on designing and building scalable NLP and ML systems that reliably validate and auto-approve patient benefit information collected over the phone.  Each day, I enjoy wearing multiple hats - research, modeling, ML infrastructure, end-to-end ML systems, and product development.

My current research interests center on NLP for specialized domains such as healthcare, involving complex reasoning and deep protocol understanding. More broadly, I'm passionate about Machine Learning, NLP, and Recommendation Systems.

Previously, I've held technical roles at Salesforce, Oracle, and PayPal. For more, see my [About page](/about/) and my [Resume](/docs/resume.pdf).
In my free time, I enjoy long-distance cycling, street and landscape [photography](https://www.instagram.com/kannar.captures/), and reading.
