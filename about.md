## Life
I have been living in San Francisco since 2018, reading fantasy fiction, long-distance cycling, taking photos, and learning Italian. My longest single day solo ride is 130 miles.

I pursued my <i>Master's in Computer Science</i> at [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/) and <i>Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering</i> at [RVCE](https://www.rvce.edu.in/).
I grew up in Udupi, a coastal quaint town in Karnataka, India, and Bangalore, the silicon valley of India.

## Industry

<kbd style="background-color: #a1f0f0; color: #000; border-radius: 5px; padding: 2px 5px; font-size: 12px;">August 2022 - Present</kbd>

#### AI Auto-Review
Currently leading the Auto-Review team, and we scaled from a single customer to 30+ customers across different tasks (benefits verification, prior authorization, pharmacy benefits management), reducing the need for human review to only complex cases.

I enhanced our ML systems for scale with robust LLM + XGBoost models along with standardized training pipelines, optimized feature extraction (reducing training duration by ~75%),  comprehensive observability, and alerting. I've actively mentored team members and championed psychological safety and inclusion. 


#### Voice Call Automation
I have been involved in building the voice call-based conversational AI system, achieving 90% IVR, Hold and Authentication call phase automation with no human intervention. This involved building a scalable ML platform that supports rapid experimentation, while ensuring low latency and high reliability. I led the development of shadow mode testing for non-disruptive model deployment in production, along with scalable model service design. I incorporated advanced NLP solutions using Gemini prompt models, BERT embeddings and phonetic signals. 

I also productionized our conversation dialog breakdown detection and human routing system (The Infinitus AI Machine [blog post](https://www.infinitus.ai/blog/the-infinitus-ai-machine/)), and explored the use of latest prompt models for better performance.

#### Service Einstein

As a part of Einstein Agent, I worked on the no-downtime migration of ML apps (Case Classification, Case Wrap-up) to an advanced ML platform. I also led machine learning application health monitoring initiatives across Service Einstein teams that involved establishing SLI/O metrics, alerts, and dashboards for preemptive issue resolution.

I also developed a proof of concept for live chat summarization during case wrap-ups and architected the project's pilot phase.


#### Field Service
As a part of the Advanced Preventive Maintenance team, I developed a robust system with an innovative DB schema for work order management of maintenance plans and assets with recurring maintenance schedules.


<b>Internship</b>: 
As a intern on the Field Service team, I developed an Entity Milestones Tracker Component for Lightning UI.

As a part of the Core team of PeopleTools, Oracle PeopleSoft, I focused primarily on ensuring our software was WCAG 2.0 compliant, allowing complete screen-reader and keyboard navigation for various elements of PeopleTools application. I stabilized the platform in terms of accessibility for PeopleTools 8.55. I also provided sessions on accessibility to Tools and Apps teams to facilitate early inclusion of accessibility into product by developers. I was involved in development and maintenance of various core PeopleTools features

I worked in the uber-cool FPTI team (First Party Tracking Infrastucture), PayPal's analytics platform.

#### Scalable Query Framework
This was my final year undergraduate research project - build a query framework to provide near-real time responses to queries over terabytes of PayPal user clickstream data. It would in turn help the Product Management make better and faster decisions for PayPal. We used Hadoop, HBase, and Elasticsearch to build the solution.

#### Real-time Analytics Dashboard
I worked on building the first visualization system using D3.JS, NodeJS and AngularJS to interface with Druid data-store of PayPal Analytics. The enhancement of this initial solution was presented in Strata+Hadoop world 2014 conference by the team at PayPal.


## Research

### Sequential Recommender Systems
<kbd style="background-color: #a1f0f0; color: #000; border-radius: 5px; padding: 2px 5px; font-size: 12px;">September 2017 - June 2018</kbd>

Master's thesis under [Prof. Julian McAuley](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/) on sequential recommender systems. I worked with metric embeddings to model user-item and item-item interactions in one metric space and incorporated various techniques to model temporal and geographical behavioural rhythms in human mobility.

### Personalized Next Song Recommendation

Modelling of user listening behaviour on Spotify and Last.fm by modelling song sequences in 30Music and NowPlaying datasets. We empirically prove the effectiveness of metric embeddings over matrix factorization and factorized markov chain models and suitably extend the embedding model.

### Modeling the Evolution of User Expertise
